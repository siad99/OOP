# Base Animal Class
class Animal:
    def move(self):
        pass  # This is a placeholder for the move method in subclasses

# Dog Class inherits from Animal
class Dog(Animal):
    def move(self):
        print("The dog is running.")

# Fish Class inherits from Animal
class Fish(Animal):
    def move(self):
        print("The fish is swimming.")

# Bird Class inherits from Animal
class Bird(Animal):
    def move(self):
        print("The bird is flying.")

# Car Class (also inherits Animal, but could represent a vehicle)
class Car(Animal):
    def move(self):
        print("The car is driving.")

# Test Polymorphism
def demonstrate_movement(animal):
    animal.move()  # Calls the move() method specific to each animal

# Creating objects of different classes
dog = Dog()
fish = Fish()
bird = Bird()
car = Car()

# Demonstrate Polymorphism
demonstrate_movement(dog)  # The dog is running
demonstrate_movement(fish)  # The fish is swimming
demonstrate_movement(bird)  # The bird is flying
demonstrate_movement(car)   # The car is driving
